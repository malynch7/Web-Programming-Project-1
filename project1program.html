            <p>
                At the beginning of each round, the player will be presented with a grid of cards, all face-down. Half
                of these cards have questions on their face, the other half have the answers to those questions. The
                player must find the matching cards by selecting two cards at a time to flip over. If the cards are a
                match, they remain face-up. If not, the cards are flipped back over, and the player must remember their
                location.
